# json-report-dependencies-with-licenses

This projects is a demo about how to generate a JSON report of all 3rd party dependencies with their respective licenses. To achieve the goal I am making use of the following plugins:

 1. [license-maven-plugin](https://www.mojohaus.org/license-maven-plugin/add-third-party-mojo.html): This plugin will generate a TXT file report with a list of all 3rd party dependencies and their respective licenses. This is the base of the JSON report.

 2. [gmavenplus-plugin](https://github.com/groovy/GMavenPlus/wiki/Examples#execute-scripts): This plugin allow us to execute a groovy script that will take the TXT report generated by `license-maven-plugin`, process it and generate a JSON report.


To generate the JSON report just do:

`./mvnw clean compile`

and see:

 a. TXT report: `${project.basedir}/target/generated-sources/license/THIRD-PARTY.txt`

 b. JSON report: `${project.basedir}/target/generated-sources/license/custom-3rd-party-report.json`
